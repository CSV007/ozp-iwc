                    The Ozone Platform's Inter-Widget Communications (IWC) enables loosely coupled integration of web
                    applications by applying the best practices of enterprise service buses and service-oriented
                    architecture to a completely in-browser system that works across multiple tabs and windows.
                    Applications can share data and services then use the data and services offered by others to enrich
                    their own user experience.
                </p>

                <h3> The IWC provides lightweight integration.</h3>
                <span>
                    Todayâ€™s rich web applications tend to carry more state than a simple link can convey, and
                    componentized development allows UI elements to be embedded, but at the cost of maintenance
                    and application size. The IWC allows application frontends to expose data and services to other
                    applications within the browser. Just like services on an ESB, these elements can be developed,
                    deployed, and extended without impact to other applications.
                </span>

                <h3> The IWC stays out of your way.</h3>
                <span>
                    The IWC is designed to minimize the impact on your application. It is completely agnostic to the
                    application presentation, including a tiny client library that adds a single, invisible element to
                    your page. It uses standard web technologies, requiring no browser plugins for IE 8+, Firefox 3.5+,
                    and all versions of Chrome and Safari.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="bodyRow">
                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <div code-doc-row url="'js/userGuide/connectPromise.js'" class ="bodyRow codeRow">
                    <p> Connecting</p>
                    <span>
                        To use IWC between applications, <b> IWC client</b> connections must be added to each application. These
                        clients connect to an IWC bus that is bound by the browser as well as the domain it is obtained
                        from.
                    </span>
                    <p></p>
                    <span>
                        In the example to the left, an IWC connection is made to the bus on domain
                        <code>http://ozone-development.github.io/iwc</code>. The actual javascript that makes up the bus
                        is gathered from that url and ran locally enclosed in the same domain.
                    </span>
                    <p></p>
                    <span>
                        All aspects of the client use promises to simplify integration with asynchronous
                        applications.
                    </span>
                </div>

                <div code-doc-row url="'js/userGuide/connectCallback.js'" class ="bodyRow codeRow">
                    <p>Callbacks vs Promises</p>
                    <span>
                        To integrate with applications that do not favor promise use, the IWC client is fully functional
                        with callback style coding.
